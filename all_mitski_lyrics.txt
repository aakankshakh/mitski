[Verse 1]
The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues, but I find that
Lately, I've been crying like a tall child

[Chorus]
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't", so I can crawl back in

[Verse 2]
And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

[Chorus]
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me

All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly when they come for my things

[Chorus 1]
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts, like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully, I was going to live

[Verse 2]
You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine, you were looking in yours

And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly, it was told to believe

[Verse 1]
I'll live in the bathtub
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need
I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw

[Chorus]
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

[Verse 2]
I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms
I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving more
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting more, more, more, oh

But, Humpty Dumpty, you're much too much
Too frail for me to touch

[Verse 1]
There's nothing left for you, nothing in this room
Try and go outside, nothing waits for you
You had it once before, not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you

[Chorus 1]
Give her all the love
You saved for it

[Bridge]
You could touch fire, you could fly
It was your right, it was your life

[Chorus 2]
And then it passed to someone new
It'll keep passing on long after you
But you're the only one
She's counting on

[Verse 1]
I guess, I guess, I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn to be somebody else
It’s been you and me since before I was me
Without you, I don't yet know quite how to live

[Verse 2]
If I could keep anything of you
I would keep just this quiet after you
It's still as a pond I am staring into
From here, I can say, "Thank you"

[Verse 1]
Everyone, all of them
Everyone said, "Don't go that way"
So, of course, to that, I said
"I think I'll go that way"

[Chorus 1]
And I left the door open to the dark
I said, "Come in, come in, whatever you are"
But it didn't want me yet

[Verse 2]
Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light

[Chorus 2]
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said, "Take it all, whatever you want"
I didn't know that I was young

[Bridge]
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take

[Verse 1]
I am hungry
I have been hungry
I was born hungry
What do I need?
I am something
I have been something
I was born something
What could I be?

[Chorus 1]
There is a light that I can see
But only, it seems, when there's darkness in me
There is a dream that I sometimes see
That only appears in the dark of sleep

[Verse 2]
I am waiting
I have been waiting
I was born waiting
I was born waiting
For that something
Just to want something
I was born something

There's a lie that I told to you
That now I can't tell the truth
And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night
I slept with a man you knew

And in the morning I walked home alone
And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights
When they were that man you knew

You told me once
You were happy to have me
But I never gave me away

There's the lie that I told to you

I would give you my heart, I think
But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
Put my heart where I couldn't reach

I didn't mind, I adored him, so
We forgot, and we left for home
And that was so long ago, now the tree it has grown
And nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground

I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I want to jump into blue water
And I miss riding horses, I miss running fast
I miss riding horses, I miss running fast
I was meant for running fast
I pretended you were mine, it made me calm, babe

I am cruel, I am gentle, I can make you laugh
I am cruel, I am gentle, I can make you laugh
I've loved many boys, I've loved many girls
I don't think about the past, it's always there anyway
Don't think about the past, always there anyway
And I will never die, I will never die
I will never die, I will never die
I will never die, I will never die
I will never die, I will never die

[Verse 1]
There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it?

[Verse 2]
Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it loveYou might also like12Embed
